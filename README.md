# Assignment-4-Clustering
# Clustering Exploration with PyCaret
Introduction
This project delves into clustering analysis using the Glass Identification dataset with PyCaret and the UCI Machine Learning Repository API. The aim is to delve into various clustering models, assess their performance across diverse preprocessing scenarios, and unveil underlying patterns within the dataset.

# Prerequisites
Ensure the installation of necessary Python packages with the following commands:

pip install ucimlrepo
pip install pycaret
# Code Overview
The code retrieves the Glass Identification dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, preprocesses it through PyCaret's setup function, and subsequently applies a range of clustering models with differing preprocessing configurations. The selection of clustering models is based on their indexing within the PyCaret model list.

# Usage
Execute the provided Python script (your_script_name.py) to conduct the clustering analysis. The script encompasses the following steps:

# Installation of required packages.
Fetching the Glass Identification dataset.
Preprocessing the data via PyCaret's setup function.
Application of various clustering models with diverse preprocessing scenarios.
Saving the results for each model and preprocessing configuration in CSV files.
Results
The outcomes are stored in CSV files, each corresponding to a distinct clustering model. These files offer insights into each model's performance across varying preprocessing conditions and cluster sizes.
Configurations
The script explores the following preprocessing configurations:

No Data Processing
Normalization Usage
Transform Application
PCA Implementation
T+N (Transform + Normalize)
T+N+PCA (Transform + Normalize + PCA)
Conclusion
This project underscores PyCaret's versatility in clustering analysis and furnishes a comprehensive overview of diverse models and preprocessing tactics. The acquired results and insights hold significance in unraveling the structure of the Glass Identification dataset.
